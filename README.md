Publication Title-Towards Morbidity Identification Employing Deep Learning and Word Embeddings within Clinical Notes
Abstract-Today,  we  are  seeing  an  ever-increasing  number  of  clinicalnotes that contain clinical results, images, and textual descriptions of pa-tient’s health state. All these data can be analyzed and employed to caternovel services that can help people and domain experts with their com-mon healthcare tasks. However, many technologies such as Deep Learn-ing and tools like Word Embeddings have started to be investigated onlyrecently, and many challenges remain open when it comes to healthcaredomain applications. To address these challenges, we propose the use ofDeep Learning and Word Embeddings for identifying sixteen morbiditytypes  within  textual  descriptions  of  clinical records.  For  this  purpose,we have used a Deep Learning model based on Bidirectional Long-ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) layers which can exploit state-of-the-art vectorrepresentations of data such as Word Embeddings. We have employedpre-trained  Word  Embeddings  namely  GloVe  and  Word2Vec,  and  our own Word Embeddings trained on the target domain. Furthermore, wehave compared the performances of the deep learning approach againstthe traditional tf-idf using Support Vector Machine (our baseline). Fromthe obtained results it seems that the combination of Deep Learning andGloVe word embeddings performs better than the baseline.
